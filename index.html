                One of the toughest choices that many researchers have to face
                during their academic career is to find an appropriate journal
                or conference to publish their works. Besides the impact of the
                journals, many other factors are also seriously considered by
                researchers before submitting their manuscripts, such as the
                correlation between their research fields and that of the journal,
                the researcherâ€™s publication history on this journal, the popularity
                of the research topics in this journal, etc. It would make this
                choice much easier if the rationality of submitting to a certain
                journal could be automatically estimated and predicted by machine
                based on the former publications in this journal. More importantly,
                this system can also help reduce the workload of journal editors if
                a paper can be automatically graded and recommended beforehand. 
              </p>
              
              <p class="content">
                Herein we propose to build up a model to characterize the rationality 
                to make decision to selecting jounrnal. In this final project, we first established 
                that the machine can distinguish research subjects between materials science and chemisty.
                The original dataset will be acquired by directly crawling the information of the
                papers from the American Chemistry Society (ACS) for Journal of Chemistry Society (JACS)
                and Wiley Publication Group for Advanced Materials (A&M) website in the past 10 years (2005~2015).
                These information such as titles, authors, contents of abstract, affiation, publication year
                etc, will be treated as input attributes for machine to learn and test. The idea of this project will be 
                similar to typical "Bags of words" model, we will process the tile and abstract to study the fequence of representative words. 
                The machine learning methods that we are going to employ are Naive Bayes, Support vector
                machines, and decision trees.

                  In the project we will work on two research areas: chemistry and material science. Chemistry is a
                  a very foundamental research subject as physics or mathematics, while material science is a newly
                  research area merged since roughly 50 years ago. Chemistry focuses on synthesis of new molecular
                  compounds or explain new phenomena at molecular scales but material science emphasizes more on
                  applications and enginneeing at interfaces of novel nano-scale materials, such as thin film devices, nano-dots.
                  These two areas certainly have mutually interested topics but they study different aspects of these
                  topics. Hence, this makses this project interesting and useful to see whether the machine and learn
                  the features of these closely related but different research subjects. 
                  
                  We particularly chose Journal of Chemistry Society (JACS) and Advanced Materials (A&M) because both are top 
                  and prestigious journals with high impact. Therefore, the articles from these two journals will be the
                  most indecative ones to show the research trends of the past decades. The data were clawed from the
                  wedsites and stored as .json datafile. An example were shown below:


                  the their own reasch areas with high impact factors. However,
