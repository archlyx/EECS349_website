                One of the toughest choices that many researchers have to face
                during their academic career is to find an appropriate journal
                or conference to publish their works. Besides the impact of the
                journals, many other factors are also seriously considered by
                researchers before submitting their manuscripts, such as the
                correlation between their research fields and that of the journal,
                the researcher’s publication history on this journal, the popularity
                of the research topics in this journal, etc. It would make this
                choice much easier if the rationality of submitting to a certain
                journal could be automatically estimated and predicted by machine
                based on the former publications in this journal. More importantly,
                this system can also help reduce the workload of journal editors if
                a paper can be automatically graded and recommended beforehand. 
              </p>
              
              <p class="content">
                Herein we propose to build up a model to characterize the rationality 
                to make decision to selecting jounrnal. In this final project, we first established 
                that the machine can distinguish research subjects between materials science and chemisty.
                The original dataset will be acquired by directly crawling the information of the
                papers from the American Chemistry Society (ACS) for Journal of Chemistry Society (JACS)
                and Wiley Publication Group for Advanced Materials (A&M) website in the past 10 years (2005~2015).
                These information such as titles, authors, contents of abstract, affiation, publication year
                etc, will be treated as input attributes for machine to learn and test. The idea of this project will be 
                similar to typical "Bags of words" model, we will process the tile and abstract to study the fequence of representative words. 
                The machine learning methods that we are going to employ are Naive Bayes, Support vector
                machines, and decision trees.

      <!-- Data
      ================================================== -->
      <div class="bs-docs-section clearfix">
        <a class="anchor" id="data"></a>
        <div class="row">

               <p class="content">
                  In the project we will work on two research areas: chemistry and material science. Chemistry is a
                  a very foundamental research subject as physics or mathematics, while material science is a newly
                  research area merged since roughly 50 years ago. Chemistry focuses on synthesis of new molecular
                  compounds or explain new phenomena at molecular scales but material science emphasizes more on
                  applications and enginneeing at interfaces of novel nano-scale materials, such as thin film devices, nano-dots.
                  These two areas certainly have mutually interested topics but they study different aspects of these
                  topics. Hence, this makses this project very interesting and useful to see whether the machine can learn
                  the features of these two closely related but different research subjects. 
                  
                  We particularly chose Journal of Chemistry Society (JACS) and Advanced Materials (A&M) because both are top 
                  and prestigious journals with high impact. Therefore, the articles from these two journals will be the
                  most indecative ones to show the research trends of the past decades. The data were clawed from the
                  wedsites and stored as .json datafile. An example were chosen from A&M and shown below:<br>
                  <br>
                  "info" : "Article first published online: 23 DEC 2014 | DOI: 10.1002/adma.201404849",<br>

                  "title" : "Flexible and Stretchable Micromagnet Arrays for Tunable Biointerfacing (pages
                  1083–1089)",<br>
                  "year" : "2015",<br>
                  "type" : "Communications",<br>
                  "abs" : "A process to surface pattern polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with ferromagnetic structures
                        of varying sizes (micrometer to millimeter) and thicknesses (>70 μm) is developed. Their
                        flexibility and magnetic reach are utilized to confer dynamic, additive properties to a variety
                        of substrates, such as coverslips and Eppendorf tubes. It is found that these substrates can
                        generate additional modes of magnetic droplet manipulation, and can tunably steer magnetic-cell
                        organization.",<br>
                  "affi" : "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles,
                         California, USA$$"<br>
                  <br>
                  As shown above, a journal infomation usually comes with several indexes and information for reader to
                  quickly locate and learn the topics of a publication. The most informative attributes are tilte and
                  abstract. Therefore, by counting the frequency of the "key words" used in titles and abstracts, we can
                  teach machine to learn what are the most related topics to either chemisty and materials science. 

                  Angewandate Chemie is also one of the top journals in chemstry area, and one of the
                  competing journals to JACS. We clawed the data from its website as well. And they will be used as test
                  samples for machine to make a prediction.

                 A python machine learning package "scikit-learn" was employed to classify the documents with a
                 bag-of-words approach. We
                 start to summarize the frequency of words shown in the titles of the publications, and the goal is to
                 let the machine learn the words more likely shown for the chemistry or materials science journals. 
                 Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) were used to filter the key words from "title" and "Abstract" and verterize the
                 dataset. The next step will enable the machine to distinguish chemistry and materials scienc so the
                 output of "0" is assigned to JACS and "1" is assigned to "Adv_Mat". And Neive Byase, Supporting Vector
                 Matrics and decision trees are the learning methods we used. 80% of the data were randomly chosen as
                 the training set and the rest 20% were used as test set. Within the 80%, 10 fold cross validation was
                 performed for each learning method. And finally, "Angewan" was used as a test set to show how good the
                 learning process it. More detailed information please refer to the attached pdf file.

                 Here are the results from three learning methods. The accuracy of each cross validation, and the whole

              <p class="content">
                 As we can see from the above results, all three methods give reasonable results but the Neive Byase
                 performs the best: XX%.

                 The future related to this project could be including more attributes. For example, the "key words" can
                 be included and treated with similar methods. "Year" is anthor important attribute to study the
                 trending of each research area, and the correlations between two journals. And finally, we can
                 certainly include more dataset by clawing data since a few decades ago, and expending the research
                 subjects to physics or biology, and some sub-areas such as organic chemistry vs. inorganic chemistry.
