% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}

\pagestyle{plain}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
One of the toughest choices that many researchers have to face during their academic career is to find an appropriate journal or conference to publish their works. Besides the impact of the journals, many other factors are also seriously considered by researchers before submitting their manuscripts, such as the correlation between their research fields and that of the journal, the researcher?s publication history on this journal, the popularity of the research topics in this journal, etc. It would make this choice much easier if the rationality of submitting to a certain journal could be automatically estimated and predicted by machine based on the former publications in this journal. More importantly, this system can also help reduce the workload of journal editors if a paper can be automatically graded and recommended beforehand.

Herein we propose to build up a model to characterize the rationality to make decision to selecting jounrnal. In this final project, we first established that the machine can distinguish research subjects between materials science and chemisty. The original dataset will be acquired by directly crawling the information of the papers from the American Chemistry Society (ACS) for Journal of Chemistry Society (JACS) and Wiley Publication Group for Advanced Materials (A\&M) website in the past 10 years (2005~2015). These information such as titles, authors, contents of abstract, affiation, publication year etc, will be treated as input attributes for machine to learn and test. The idea of this project will be similar to typical bag-of-words approach, we will process the title and abstract to study the importance of representative word with respect to the journals. The machine learning methods that we are going to employ are Naive Bayes, Support vector machines, and decision trees.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}

%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


\section{Data}
In the project we will work on two research areas: chemistry and material science. Chemistry is a a very foundamental research subject as physics or mathematics, while material science is a newly research area merged since roughly 50 years ago. Chemistry focuses on synthesis of new molecular compounds or explain new phenomena at molecular scales but material science emphasizes more on applications and enginneeing at interfaces of novel nano-scale materials, such as thin film devices, nano-dots. These two areas certainly have mutually interested topics but they study different aspects of these topics. Hence, this makses this project very interesting and useful to see whether the machine can learn the features of these two closely related but different research subjects.

We particularly chose Journal of Chemistry Society (JACS) and Advanced Materials(A\&M) because both are top and prestigious journals with high impact. Therefore, the articles from these two journals will be the most indecative ones to show the research trends of the past decades. An example were chosen from A\&M and shown in Table \ref{tab:data-sample}.

\end{table}

The journal information usually comes with several indexes and information for reader to quickly locate and learn the topics of a publication. The most informative attributes are tilte and abstract. Therefore, by counting the frequency of the "key words" used in titles and abstracts, we can teach machine to learn what are the most related topics to either chemisty and materials science. Angewandate Chemie is also one of the top journals in chemstry area, and one of the competing journals to JACS. We pulled the data from its website as well. And they will be used as test samples for machine to make a prediction.

Out datasets include 32268 papers in JACS, 9008 papers in A\&M and 21887 papers in Angewandte Chemie ranging from 2005 to 2015.

\section{Experiments}

The python machine learning package scikit-learn was employed to classify the documents with a bag-of-words approach. We started with estimating how frequently the words show in the titles and abstracts of a certain journal. Term frequency?inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) was therefore used to measure the importance of the words by considering the appearance of a certain word in both the given papers and the general corpus. In bag-of-wods approach, each title and abstract are vectorized to a sparse vector filled with the values given by TF-IDF transform as an instance of training set. The target value of each instance is the journal type (e.g., JACS corresponds to 0 and A\&M is 1 in our case).

80\% of our data were randomly chosen as the training set and the rest 20\% were used as test set. 10 fold cross validation was performed for the training set to check how well the machine learning model can be generalized to independent dataset. The papers in the journal Angewandte Chemie were used as a independent dataset to test our model, since it is as prestigious as JACS in the chemistry field. Herein we use Naive Bayes, Supporting Vector Machine and Decision Tree as the machine learning techniques in order to obtain the best results.

\section{Results}
We apply the three machine learning methods to two different datasets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Including only titles information}
    \item{Including both titles and abstracts information}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset with only titles}
The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:acc-title}.

\begin{table}
    \caption{The accuracy of the three machine learning methods with only titles included in datasets\label{tab:acc-title}}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c}
            \hline
            \bf{Methods} & \bf{Training Set} & \bf{Test Set} & \bf{AC Test} \\
            \hline
            Naive Bayes & 0.9666 & 0.9484 & 0.8479 \\
            \hline
            Linear SVC & 0.9011 & 0.9004 & 0.7806 \\
            \hline
            Decision Tree & 0.9967 & 0.9964 & 0.1010 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Naive Bayes}
Naive Bayes gives the most reasonable results among the three methods. The model derived from the training set not only fit the test set well, but also gives good prediction for the Angewandte Chemie test. Around 85\% of the papers of Angewandte Chemie are classified to chemistry.

\subsubsection{SVM}
Specifically we are using SVM with linear kernel and minimization of the squared hinge loss ( LinearSVC in scikit-learn). LinearSVC is very sensitive to the regularization parameter C. Large C will result in overfitting of the training set and very poor accuracy for Angewandte Chemie test. In our experiment, we use C = 0.004. Around 78\% of the papers in Angewandte Chemie are identified as acceptable to JACS.

\subsubsection{Decision Tree}
Decision Tree: We attempt to avoid overfitting problem by limiting the maximum depth of the decision tree. However, it does not improve much of our results: Decision Tree can fit perfectly with training set and test set, while it only put 10\% of the Angwandte Chemie papers to the correct class.

\subsection{Dataset with titles and abstracts}

The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:acc-abs}.

\begin{table}
    \caption{The accuracy of the three machine learning methods with titles and abstracts included in datasets\label{tab:acc-abs}}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c}
            \hline
            \bf{Methods} & \bf{Training Set} & \bf{Test Set} & \bf{AC Test} \\
            \hline
            Naive Bayes & 0.8955 & 0.8838 & 0.9430 \\
            \hline
            Linear SVC & 0.9589 & 0.9529 & 0.8718 \\
            \hline
            Decision Tree & 0.9966 & 0.9962 & 0.1007 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

With both titles and abstracts included in the dataset, the prediction accuracies for the Angewandte Chemie set of NB and LinearSVC are improved (NB: 94\%, LinearSVC: 87\%). For NB, the accuracy of the training set and test set is lower than before, since more information is taken into consideration for the classification. It is likely that some words in the abstract can be both included in JACS and A\&M. For LinearSVC, one can adjust the parameter C to obtain better accuracy for all the datasets. For DT, the accuracy of all the datasets are almost the same as before.

\subsection{Performance}
The performance of the three machine learning methods are shown in Table \ref{tab:performance}. Apparently, Naive Bayes uses the least amount of time while giving relatively good results compared with other methods.

\begin{table}
    \caption{The elapsed learning time of the three machine learning methods with titles and abstracts included in datasets\label{tab:performance}}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c | c }
            \hline
            \bf{Methods} & \bf{Time (Second)} \\
            \hline
            Naive Bayes &  0.036 \\
            \hline
            Linear SVC & 0.197 \\
            \hline
            Decision Tree &  \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, NB and Linear SVC perform well in predicting the appropriate journal to submit, while DT is not suitable for this type of problem.

The future work of this project could be including more attributes. For example, Keywords can be included and treated with similar methods. Year is another important attribute to study the trending of each research area, and the correlations between two journals. More practical test datasets can also be introduced to verify our machine learning model. Additionally, we can certainly include more dataset by extracting data since a few decades ago, and expending the research subjects to physics or biology, and some sub-areas such as organic chemistry vs. inorganic chemistry.
